## How do I find the identifier of the show I want to download?
* IDs can be found in the details section at the bottom of the page (just about reviews), alongside 'Lineage' and 'Transferred by' etc.
* ID's can also be found in the web-address of the archive.org page, just after `/details/`
  * Given a show https://archive.org/details/gd1977-05-09.123480.sbd.miller.flac16
  * Then the identifier would be `gd1977-05-09.123480.sbd.miller.flac16` 

## In the future, you should be able to use Deadlist to
* Get formats a show is available in
* Get lists of uploads by date
* Get setlists for a specific date
* Get lists of recordings for specific shows, including set lists and information about the upload, transferrer etc.
